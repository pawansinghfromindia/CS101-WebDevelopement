How to manage and link external stylesheets, making your web development process more streamlined and organized.

## KEY CONCEPTS AND COMMANDS

### ðŸ“™ Creating an External Stylesheet
Use the ```.css file``` extension (e.g., styles.css). <br/>
Use the ```<link>``` tag to link the CSS file in the HTML document: <br/>
In HTML File, add link tag
```<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">```

### ðŸ“— Organizing Project Files
Place HTML files in the root directory. <br/> 
Create a styles folder for CSS files. <br/>
Create a scripts folder for JavaScript files (if applicable). <br/>

### ðŸ“• HTML and CSS Validation
Validate HTML using W3C Validator. <br/>
Validate CSS using the CSS Validator at [jigsaw.w3.org](https://jigsaw.w3.org/) css-validator.

### ðŸ“˜ Main Points

âœ“ We have been using internal stylesheet to add our CSS code directly to the HTMl doc with the ```<style>``` element.

But What if we want to apply same set of styles to the entire website not just one page.

âœ“ Rather than copying and pasting your style tag in each page, each time make changes, You can simlply use an EXTERNAL STYLESHEET

âœ“ This is a css file that can be linked to in ```<head>``` tag of HTML doc so that you can change all styles at once by editing only one file.

âœ“ Standard file name for CSS -> ```styles.css``` for a project or website with only one stylesheet.

âœ“ If the styles.css is in the same folder as index.html then they're called as neighbours. <br/>
So the location relationship means you can refer from one to other just by using the file name


âœ“ Once a project gets bigger than a few files, organization of files becomes important. <br/>
Having all the files in the same folders/directory gets confusing. 

âœ“ The usual file structure is to keep  the HTML files in the root directory and then another directory called styles to hold css files
and another folder called scripts for JavaScript files.
