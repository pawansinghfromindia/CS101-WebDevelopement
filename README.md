- It doesn't really matter whether you're using this tool or that tool. It is important to know How you go around, navigate between all of the panels and remember the shortcuts so that you can be proficient with the keyboard.

- No Code Editor can make you a better coder but knowing your code Editor better can make you a faster developer.

- We need only 2 tools for entire Web development
### üßë‚Äçüíª 1. Code Editor

- Notepad or Microsoft Word, they're the word processor that means they have features like change the color, bold or Itallic the font, change font-size, etc So basically these are word formator
- What we need is Code Editor which can gives us Code Highlight, Auto Completion, Suggestions, can read through files and folders.
- Example : VS CODE, Sublime Text, Intellij, Netbeans etc
- Cursor code editor is trending these days - Paid

- VS Code
  - Microsoft Product, Opensource

## Let's learn few shortcuts 

- Don't mug up eventually as habit you'll remember all of them
- Create a file one.txt | two.txt | three.txt
- hello.html or index.html -> very common name
- Now let's see how we can navigate between the files ``` ctrl + shift + P``` Pallet another way is without touching mouse ```ctrl + p``` name file and enter 

### ü™íLet's learn some of the Shortcuts ‚úÇÔ∏è

- 1. ```ctrl + shift + p``` This is a pallet, It does so many things for you. 
  - This is like your immediate controlling Command Centre for VS Code.
  - For example you want to open an extension so go ahead & tell like Live code, want to create file type file & create it

- 2. ```ctrl + P``` faster way to move from one file to another without touching mouse

- 3. ```ctrl + ,``` comma to open some of the setting file

- You will also need terminal, vs code gives you that option 

- 4. ```ctrl + ~ tilde``` VS Code also provide you a terminal. So use it.

- 5. ```ctrl + b``` This actually toggles side bars and quite common to space on your code to wide your code screen

- 6. ```ctrl + w``` to close open file

- 7. ```ctrl + s``` to save the file

- 8. ```ctrl + x``` cut

- 9. ```ctrl + v``` paste

- 10. ```ctrl + z``` undo

| Windows 11| MacOS |
|------------|----------|
| ctrl key	 | command key |
| alt key	   | option key  |


### üö£ How we navigate through the code?

- Coding proficiently means How quickly you can navigate through your keyboard. That's interesting!
- It's a skill in itself and comes over the year.
- ```ctrl + left/right arrow key``` can move you from line start or the end
- ```ctrl + shift + arrow key``` you can also move one word at a time.
- ```alt + shift + down arrow key``` copy line
- ```ctrl + x``` delete the line
- ```alt + up/down arrow``` exchange the line 1 to line 2 | No need to copy cut paste
- ```alt + move the cursor by clicking``` It will write on multiple lines simultaneously
- ```ctrl + d``` to highlight the same word in the whole file 
- ```! + tab key``` it will generate HTML boiler plate code
- tab key does miracle in HTML code auto generation
