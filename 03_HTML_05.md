  - **```<h4>```** little little less
  - **```<h5>```** little little little less

## ðŸ“™ paragraph 

**p** paragraph is just a text content. <br/>
This is how usually a web page is designed. <br/>

## ðŸ“• Images 

**Images** : ```<img src="./folder_name/image.jpg" alt="">``` <br> Here there is no closing tag for images. <br/>

```html
  <img src="./images/programming.png" width="300px" height="" alt="">
```

## ðŸ“— Link 

**Link** : anchor tag to link other pages/websites ```<a href="https://x.com"> Go to X </a>``` <br/>

    <a href="tel:+919876543210">Mobile</a>
    <a href="./index.html">Go to index</a>
```

## ðŸ“™ HTML Element 

There is a terminology, How everything is being known like ```<h2>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</h2>``` this whole thing is known as **Element** including 
the starting tag ```<h1>```, content ```Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.``` and end tag ```</h2>``` So this is an h1 element. <br/>

**```<a href="https://x.com"> Go to X </a>```**, Here ```href=""```,```src="" alt=""``` is an **attribute**, these're properties of a tag,
which has some **name** like href,src,alt etc etc and we pass **value** to them.<br>

> âœ¨ **Some of tags have property, some of them they don't have. We can additionally provide them.**

```html
  <h1 title="Hello">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur.</h1>

  <h1 title="New tool tips">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur.</h1>
```

## ðŸ“— lists

**lists** : Lists are of 2 types, <br/>
**1. UnOrdered list**```<ul></ul>``` means, List is there but order is not that much important. <br/>
    example : Buying Grossary items, order doesn't matter.
**2. Ordered List**```<ol></ol>```  means, Importance of order is there. <br/>
    example : Giving cooking instructions, order really matters.

```html
<ul>
       <li>Mango</li>
       <li>Apple</li>
       <li>Orange</li>
</ul>


<ol>
      <li>Read</li>
      <li>Understand</li>
      <li>Write</li>
</ol>
```

## ðŸ“™ block vs inline

###  **Concept of Block Element and Inline Element** :

  - **Block Level Element** : The name itself suggests Block means It's a block.
  - **Inline Elements** : Inline means I will come within line the line.
 
  - How to figure out difference between them? <br/>
    **Block level element** goes from left to right <br> It takes the entire block of your browser that's your block level element. <br/>
    Example : ```<h1 title="Hello">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur.</h1> ```
    <br/>
    **Inline element**,on the other hand they goes within the line, they don't consume or claim the territory of the entire block. <br/>
    Example : ``` <img src="./images/programming.png" width="300px" height="" alt="">```

 - You can go on the webpage and inspect which element is block element and hich element is inline by hovering over the element.

## ðŸ“• div

- **```<div> </div>```**, In the HTML, there is also known as **Container** and **div** is considered as container, div is just a wraper, a box. <br/>
  It doesn't do anything it's just a container. <br/>
  ```html
      <div>
        <h1>Block level elements</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>heading h1 to h6</li> 
            <li>ol, li</li> 
            <li>ul, li</li>     
            <li>p</li> 
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1>Inline elements</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>a tags</li>
            <li>img</li>
            <li>strong</li>
            <li>em</li>
        </ul>
      </div>   
  ```

 - **```<strong> </strong>```** strong tag and **```<b> </b>```** bold tag. <br/>
   ```html
      <p>Lorem ipsum <strong>dolor</strong> sit amet.</p>
      <p>Lorem ipsum <b>dolor</b> sit amet.</p>
    ```
<br/>

Both makes no difference when you see, But the difference between the understandability of the screen readers and the accessibilty of the website.  
When you say bold, It's just a bold. It doesn't do anything extra. <br/>
But when you say strong that means there is some strong emphasis with this particular keyword, there is some importance of it. <br/>
That's what the HTML is about. Laying down where the importance of the figure is/some word.

- **```<em> </em>```** Emphasis, here em is there should be emphasis on this word when screen reader read the content **```<i> </i>```** Itallic, i is just a fancy nature
   of displaying visual hierarchy. <br/>

- This is why all these ```<strong>``` tag, ```<em>``` emphasis tag, ```<img/>``` tag, ```<a>``` anchor tag etc are inline tag. <br/>
   It doesn't consume end to end, doesn't create new block on its own. <br/>
   It does all these changes within ther place within inline. <br/>


> **Note :- You don't need to learn everything in HTML! In fact nobody knows  everything in HTML. You learn on the go, on the basis of requirement basis.**
