# 🚀 CSS Basics Colors

Different ways to specify colors in CSS, moving beyond simple color names to more precise methods.

Explore the hexadecimal (hex) color system, RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color values, and HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) color values.

Each system allows you to define colors with varying levels of detail and precision. 

- Hexadecimal values use a #RRGGBB format, RGB values use rgb(r, g, b), 
- HSL values use hsl(h, s%, l%).

- alpha value in RGBA and HSLA, which controls the opacity of colors.

use these different color systems to enhance the visual design of your web pages.

## KEY CONCEPTS AND COMMANDS

### 📙 Hexadecimal Colors
Format: #RRGGBB <br/>
Example: ```#0000ff``` (blue)

### 📗 RGB Colors
Format: rgb(r, g, b) <br/>
Example: ```rgb(0, 0, 255)``` (blue)

### 📕 HSL Colors
Format: hsl(h, s%, l%) <br/>
Example: ```hsl(240, 100%, 50%)``` (blue)

### 📙 Alpha Value (Opacity)
RGBA: rgba(r, g, b, a) <br/>
HSLA: hsla(h, s%, l%, a) <br/>
Example: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.5) (semi-transparent blue)

### 📗 Color Pickers and Calculators
Using tools like W3Schools’ color calculators to find and preview colors


### ♥️ CSS Basics : Color System

- Simple color names -> red green blue purple
- Hexadecimal -> supported in all browsers #RRGGBB
- RGB(Red Green Blue) -> rgb(0,255,0)
- HSL(Hue Saturation Lightness) -> supported in most modern browsers not in all of them. 

✓ Hue is represented by a color wheel from 0 to 360 0=red, 120=green 240=blue ```hsl(300,20%,50%)``` <br/>

✓ Saturation & lightness represented by % saturation=0 means a shade of grey and 100% means full color lightness=0 means black and 100% means white. <br/>

- ```hsl()``` and ```rgb()``` both offers a forth value that is Alpha which is a, which means Opacity. It can be between 0 to 1

# 🚀 CSS Basics Borders

use CSS to create and style borders around HTML elements.

- how to define border styles, widths, and colors using CSS properties.

- importance of using relative units of measurement, such as percentages and REM, for responsive design

- how to apply borders to different elements, including text and images, and how to use padding to adjust the space around elements

create visually appealing borders and ensure your web pages are responsive and accessible.

## KEY CONCEPTS AND COMMANDS

### 📕 CSS Border Properties
border-style (defines the style of the border, e.g., solid, dashed) <br/>
border-width (defines the width of the border, usually in pixels) <br/>
border-color (defines the color of the border) <br/>

 
> **Pixel is an absolute unit of measurement. It will appear same size on any screen.**

### 📗 Units of Measurement

**1. Pixels (px)** : Absolute unit of measurement, consistent across screens.

**2. Percentages (%)** : Relative to the parent element’s size.
Another unit - Percentage, Relative unit of measurement- refers to the parent element's size.

**3. REM** : Relative to the root element’s font size, useful for responsive design.
Another size unit : REM, equivalent to the size of the root element's font size. It is relative unit of measurement. That means -
On a laptop screen ~16px
On a mobile screen ~10px
On a larger screen that's been configured to have larger text = same size of the base font size 

### 📘 Best Practice : 
Set rules for image width. <br/>
Height will automatically adjust. <br/>

### 📙 CSS Selectors
Combining element and class selectors (e.g., p.important to select paragraphs with the class important).

### 📒 Responsive Design
Using relative units like percentages and REM for responsive layouts. Ensuring elements adjust appropriately across different screen sizes.

### HTML Basics
Adding images with the <img> tag and alt attribute for accessibility. <br/>
Applying CSS styles to images, including borders and sizes.

### Text Editor Usage
Opening, editing files and Saving files in Text Editor like VSCode. SublimeText, Atom etc 

### Browser Usage
Viewing HTML files, Refreshing the browser to see changes like Chrome, Safari, Edge etc

### HTML and CSS Validation
Using [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check HTML and CSS code.

# 🚀 CSS Precedence

CSS rules of precedence, which determine how browsers resolve conflicts between different CSS rules.

✓ CSS is cascading, meaning rules are inherited i.e. trickle down and can sometimes conflict. 
Understanding How browsers resolve conflicts is vital.

- Browsers resolve these conflicts based on two main factors:  <br/>
**the order in which the rules are defined** and <br/>
**the specificity of the selectors.**

✓ Rules defined later in the stylesheet take precedence over earlier ones, and more specific selectors take precedence over less specific ones. 

✓ Use Chrome’s DevTools to inspect and understand how these rules are applied and overridden.

✓ Understanding of how to manage CSS conflicts and ensure your styles are applied as intended.

## KEY CONCEPTS AND COMMANDS

### 🍁 CSS Precedence
- Order of Rules: Later rules override earlier ones.
- Specificity: More specific selectors override less specific ones.

### 🍁 CSS Selectors
- Element Selector: Targets HTML elements by their tag name (e.g., p).
- Class Selector: Targets elements by their class attribute, preceded by a period (.) (e.g., .purple-text).
- ID Selector: Targets elements by their ID attribute, preceded by a hash (#) (e.g., #lead- paragraph).

### 🍁 USING CHROME DEVTOOLS
Inspecting elements to see applied styles and understand conflicts. Viewing computed styles and overridden rules

### 🍁 CSS Syntax
Writing CSS rules with selectors, properties, and values (e.g., p { color: blue; }).  Understanding how specificity and order affect rule application.

### 🍁 Debugging CSS
Using DevTools to identify and resolve conflicts. <br/>
Checking for overridden styles and understanding why certain rules are applied.


✓ Rule Precedence is a fundamental concept in CSS. 
Understanding It will make you much more effective coder. 
It also helps immensely with debugging. <br/>

✓ Whenever your style are being applied in a way that doesn't make sense, check in the browser DevTool for conflicts. 
That will be very often be the root of the problem.
