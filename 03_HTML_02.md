We learn about **sectioning elements in HTML, which help structure the content of your web pages**. <br/>

Create a new HTML file and use various sectioning tags like ```<header>```, ```<footer>```, ```<section>```, ```<article>```, and ```<aside>```. <br/>
These tags help organize your content logically, making it easier for both browsers and developers to understand and manage. <br/>

### KEY CONCEPTS 

### üìçHTML Sectioning Elements

- ```<header>``` <br/>
  contains introductory content or navigation links

> **```<header>``` != ```<head>```**

- **```<head>```** <br/>
  contains metadata about HTML document, that is information for the browser, developers nothing related to what have to be rendered/shown on the webpage. <br/>

- **```<headers>```** <br/>
  elements does contains information that has been rendered on the website. <br/>
  Usually introductory information like Headlines. <br/>
  It can also contains navigation bars or links logos. <br/>

- **```<nav>```** <br/>
  contains navigation links <br/>

- ```<footer>``` <br/>
  contains footer content like copyright information. <br/>
  Name itself denotes foot or at the end of the document. <br/>
  They usually contains things like copyright, contact info, privacy statements, terms of use, site maps and stuffs like that. <br/>
  You can have one footer or footer for each section as you wish. <br/>

- ```<section>```
  groups related content together. <br/>

In newspaper we will have sports sections, business sections, similarly we have 2 articles about sports we want both of them in same section and
we want to give that section a heading so that user/reader knows what to expect. <br/>
It's about the content not the style of the webpage. <br/>
Let's add some content to the section we will start with a heading that describe the theme of the group content. <br/>

- **```<article>```**
  contains independent, self-contained content. <br/>
  - <article> element is used to contain independent content. Content that make sense on it own independent from the context of the rest of the website. <br/>
  Like news articles, blog post
  - <article> tags differs from the <section> tags that article specify independent self-contained content while section element will group together 
    related article while an article should make sense on its own.

- **```<aside>```** <br/>
  contains content related to the surrounding content.
  - <aside> tag defines content aside from the content it is placed in but related to the surrounding content.
  - This is similar to a sidebar in a newspaper.
  - Example : It could be used to feature a great farmer's market to get ingredients for a recipe

### üìç HTML Validation

Using [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check HTML code

- Browser renders the page exactly what we write the code in out HTML Doc file.

- So, All of elements appears in one vertical line. This is because we are using HTML for structure only. To style the page and position our element.
   We will need to use CSS.

- Using the HTML Structure elements properly will make your code cleaner and easier to read for
  both browser and any web developer who might look into your code later on.

- A webpage can contains as many sections and articles as we want, just like a newspaper. We can keep adding sections and articles all day.
