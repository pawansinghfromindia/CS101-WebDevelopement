# 🚀 Semantic HTML

We’ll learn to use semantic HTML elements, which not only improve the accessibility of your web pages but also boost their SEO performance 
by making your content more understandable to search engines. <br/>

## 📍 Semantic HTML Elements

✓ We'll learn about semantic elements in HTML, which help describe the meaning of the content to both machines and humans. <br/>

✓ Semantic elements, such as ```<header>```, ```<footer>```, ```<section>```, ```<article>```, and ```<aside>```, provide clear information about the type of content
they contain, improving accessibility and SEO. <br/>

✓ Create a new HTML file and use these semantic tags to structure your content. <br/>

✓ Importance of separating structure (HTML) from style (CSS), and how to use semantic tags to make your HTML more meaningful and easier to read. <br/>

✓ A well-structured semantic webpage and understand how to validate your HTML to ensure it’s error-free. <br/>


## 📍Semantics Elements : 

✓ Describe the meaning of the content to both machines and humans. <br/>
✓ Elements whose tags say something about  the kind of content they contain. <br/>
✓ Using Semantic tags allows search engines to better understand your site's content. <br/>
✓ It allows screen readers to work more accurately. <br/>
✓ Makes writing HTML easier. <br/>

- **Semantic Elements** are new feature in HTML 5 <br/>
  ```<head>``` ```<p>``` ```<li>```

- **Not semantic elements** : <br/>
  ```<div>``` ```<span>``` they don't tell about what is  contained within and therefore no define structure. <br/>

These elements are used to defined groups of content to be styled in a particular way using CSS. <br/>

Most coders are moving away from overusing these elements for any other purpose. <br/>

### 🎁 One of the Goals of HTML5:

✔ Separate Structure and  Style. <br/>
✔ HTML which is markup that describe the meaning of the content. <br/>
✔ CSS which is style that describe style or appearance. <br/> 

## 📍 HTML Semantic Elements

```<header>``` (contains introductory content or navigation links) <br/>
```<nav>``` (contains navigation links) <br/>
```<footer>``` (contains footer content like copyright information) <br/>
```<section>``` (groups related content together) <br/>
```<article>``` (contains independent, self-contained content) <br/>
```<aside>``` (contains content related to the surrounding content) <br/>
```<h1>```, ```<h2>```, ```<h3>```, ```<h4>``` (header tags indicating importance) <br/>

```<h1>``` indicates that this is the most important heading. <br/>
  Best practice is one h1 per page. <br/>

```<h1>``` to ```<h6>``` indicates heading of decreasing importance. <br/>
  Less important ones appears smaller. <br/>

```<p>``` (paragraph tag) <br/>
```<em>``` (emphasized text) <br/>
```<strong>``` (strongly emphasized text) <br/>
```<q>``` (inline quote) <br/>
```<blockquote>``` (block quote) <br/>
```<u>``` (underlined text) <br/>
```<small>``` (smaller text) <br/>
```<br>``` (line break) <br/>

> **Don't be intimidated when errors pop up. You just have to read carefully, find the impacted line, have patience and googling skills, you can fix anything.**

### 📍 HTML Basics
```<!DOCTYPE html>``` (HTML5 declaration) <br/>
```<html lang="en">``` (HTML tag with language attribute) <br/>
```<head>``` (head section for metadata) <br/>
```<meta charset="utf-8">``` (character encoding) <br/>
```<title>``` (title of the webpage) <br/>
```<body>``` (body section for content) <br/>

### 📍 Text Editor Usage

Opening, editing files and Saving files in Text Editor like VSCode. SublimeText, Atom etc 

### 📍 Browser Usage

Viewing HTML files, Refreshing the browser to see changes like Chrome, Safari, Edge etc

### 📍 HTML Validation

Using [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check HTML code

## 🍂 Building a semantic HTML Page

We have seen enough of the basics, theoritical part of HTML like creating h1 tag, paragraph, some of the list elements and tables and forms. <br/>
Now It's time to build an entire webpage, not the perfect realistic but very close to it along with the semantic of HTML. <br/>

### 📍 Semantics of HTML

**Semantics of HTML**  is really an interesting topics in which so much of amazing stuffs can happen around that. <br/>

Semantic actually guides your HTML page that **How the content should be structured and wrapped around?** <br/>

There used to a time when everything wrapped around just under ```<div>``` and now no longer this is the case. <br/>

Now we actually have better sematic tags so that we can wrap around entire page and It can do so much justice to the screen readers and other places where 
your data can be consumed. <br/>

Semantic is all about How your web page looks, accessible and nice for the screen reader as well as It serves a good purpose in HTML in general. <br/>

**Semantic HTML elements discribe its meaning to both the browser and the developer** <br/>

### 📍 Importants Points

- ✨ **meta tags** <br/>
  These are metadata information about your webpage, how it looks like on the webport, what character set you're using UTF-8 or UTF-16 or Chinese characters,
  Japanese Characters, Hindi Characters then UTF structure changed.

- 🎉 **UTF = "Unicode Transformation Format"** <br/>
  It is a standard for encoding characters in electronic communication and is widely used in computing and web development. <br/>
  ```UTF``` includes various encodings such as ```UTF-8```, ```UTF-16```, and ```UTF-32```, each designed to handle different character sets and requirements. <br/>
  ```UTF-8```, in particular, is the most popular encoding and is backwards compatible with ASCII. <br/>

  
```html
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
            <title> Document </title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1> Heading </h2>
            <p> Paragraph </p>
        </body>
        </html>
```

- 🎆 Sometimes you will see you load some of the scripts as well ```<script> </script>```, these scripts are nothing but script which load some script external javascript or some code. It's very common thing.

- 🎇 Apart from this sometimes you even load your CSS as well, ```<style> </style>```, if you want to have style contents.

### 📍 Attributes

- 🪔 There are 2 attributes which are very common ```class=""``` and ```id=""``` used with any element, known as **global attribute**. <br/>
[click here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes) <br/>
There are so many global attributes that can be injected in any of the element. These are very very helpful for the CSS.

- ✨ There used to be a way designing a web page using ```div``` but now we have semantics

```html
    <body>
        <div class="header">
            <h1> Headings </h1>
        </div>
        
        <div class="footer">
            This is a footer
        </div>
    </body>
```
- 🔖 HTML 5 gives us sematic tags, says hey these sematics tags are availble and try to go ahead and document or struture your website. <br/>

[Sematics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics) <br/>

Again these sematics are container tags and they just seperate out your content little bit nothing much they don't do anything on their own. <br/>

We have many of them like mentioned below <br/>
|     Container tags       |
|--------------------------|
| ```<header> </header>``` |
| ```<footer> </footer>``` |
| ```<nav> </nav>``` |
| ```<section> </section>``` |
| ```<main> </main>``` |
| ```<article> </article>``` |
| ```<summary> </summary>``` |
| ```<figure> </figure>``` |

```html
    <body>
        <header>
            <h1>Headings</h1>
        </header>
    
        <footer>
            This is a footer
        </footer>
    </body>
```

- Sometime people actually wrap these heading inside another group ```<hgroup> </hgroup>``` <br/>
  It is just a heading group tag. <br/>

**From this** ⬇️ <br/>

```html
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Learn to creates</h1>
        <h2>You can learn with us and build your own website.</h2>
    </header>
</body>
```


**To this** ⬇️ <br/>

```html
  <header>
        <hgroup>
            <h1>Learn to creates</h1>
            <h2>You can learn with us and build your own website.</h2>
        </hgroup>
  </header>
```

> **We can auto indent our code in VS Code using the plugin called Prettier, install it and configure it from setting if it doesn't work.**


> **BTW, It does really mean that if you're putting any content at the top it will always remain at top. CSS is perfectly capable of moving any content
from top to bottom, It can change the position.**

- **```<nav> </nav>```** nav element is navigation bar, usually are made of unordered lists. 

- We have seen here ```<header> </header>```,```<hgroup> </hgroup>```,```<article> </article>```,```<time> </time>```,```<section> </section>```,
  ```<code> </code>```,```<footer> </footer>```,```<address> </address>```

- ✨ We can use special character symbol like copywrite etc etc using ```'&'``` to generate special character and thanks to ```charset="UTF-8"``` which provide this styling and encoding.
