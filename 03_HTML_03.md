they contain, improving accessibility and SEO. <br/>

## 📍Semantics Elements : 

✓ Describe the meaning of the content to both machines and humans. <br/>
✓ Elements whose tags say something about  the kind of content they contain. <br/>
✓ Using Semantic tags allows search engines to better understand your site's content. <br/>
✓ It allows screen readers to work more accurately. <br/>
✓ Makes writing HTML easier. <br/>

- **Semantic Elements** are new feature in HTML 5 <br/>
  ```<head>``` ```<p>``` ```<li>```

- **Not semantic elements** : <br/>
  ```<div>``` ```<span>``` they don't tell about what is  contained within and therefore no define structure. <br/>

These elements are used to defined groups of content to be styled in a particular way using CSS. <br/>

Most coders are moving away from overusing these elements for any other purpose. <br/>

### 🎁 One of the Goals of HTML5:

✔ Separate Structure and  Style. <br/>
✔ HTML which is markup that describe the meaning of the content. <br/>
✔ CSS which is style that describe style or appearance. <br/> 

## 📍 HTML Semantic Elements

```<header>``` (contains introductory content or navigation links) <br/>
```<nav>``` (contains navigation links) <br/>
```<footer>``` (contains footer content like copyright information) <br/>
```<section>``` (groups related content together) <br/>
```<article>``` (contains independent, self-contained content) <br/>
```<aside>``` (contains content related to the surrounding content) <br/>
```<h1>```, ```<h2>```, ```<h3>```, ```<h4>``` (header tags indicating importance) <br/>

```<h1>``` indicates that this is the most important heading. <br/>
  Best practice is one h1 per page. <br/>

```<h1>``` to ```<h6>``` indicates heading of decreasing importance. <br/>
  Less important ones appears smaller. <br/>

```<p>``` (paragraph tag) <br/>
```<em>``` (emphasized text) <br/>
```<strong>``` (strongly emphasized text) <br/>
```<q>``` (inline quote) <br/>
```<blockquote>``` (block quote) <br/>
```<u>``` (underlined text) <br/>
```<small>``` (smaller text) <br/>
```<br>``` (line break) <br/>

> **Don't be intimidated when errors pop up. You just have to read carefully, find the impacted line, have patience and googling skills, you can fix anything.**
