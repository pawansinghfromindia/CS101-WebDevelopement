## ✨ Basic CSS Selectors: Element, Class, & ID

- different types of CSS selectors, which allow you to apply styles to specific HTML elements. 
- explore how to use class and ID selectors in addition to element selectors.

## ⭐ Class selectors

- which start with a period (.), are used to apply styles to multiple elements.
- Class selectors are used when you want to style multiple elements that share a common style. 
- You can apply the same class to many elements, and the style will affect all of them.

## ☀️ ID selectors

- which start with a hash (#), are used for unique elements.
- ID selectors are used when you need to style a single, unique element on the page.
- An ID should only be used once per page.

> **Importance of using classes for shared styles and IDs for specific styles, although using IDs in CSS is no longer considered best practice.**

## 🌟 KEY CONCEPTS AND COMMANDS

CSS Selectors :
   
  - Element Selector: Targets HTML elements by their tag name (e.g., h1, p).
 
  - Class Selector: Targets elements by their class attribute, preceded by a period (.) (e.g., .purple-text).

  - ID Selector: Targets elements by their ID attribute, preceded by a hash (#) (e.g., #lead- paragraph).

### 🌟 HTML Basics

- Adding class and ID attributes to HTML elements (e.g., class="purple-text", id="lead- paragraph")

### ☀️ CSS Syntax

- Writing CSS rules with selectors, properties, and values (e.g., .purple-text { color: purple; }).

- Combining multiple classes in a single element (e.g., class="important purple-text").

### 🌝 CSS Basics

- Apply styles rules to different HTML elements
- Other ways of selecting elements to apply styles

- If Selector is an HTML element -> Type the name of the element

- If Selector is a class name -> preceded by a period .(dot)

- Classes ae used for shared style

- If selector is a id name -> preceded by a hash #

- Ids can be used for extremely specific style; only apply to one element in a page.

- Any given Id can be only apply to one element in an HTML Page

> **Note : Use of Ids with CSS is no longer best practice. However They're used in combination with Javascript oftenly.**

### 🌕 Types of Selectors

Pseudo Classes and Attribute selectors <br/>

- select elements based on state (e.g.hover)

- Selectors on state are called as Pseudo classes
  
- select elements based on their attributes (e.g. href="https")


### 🌞 BEST PRACTICES

Using classes for shared styles and IDs for unique styles. <br/>

Avoiding overuse of IDs in CSS, as they are better suited for JavaScript. <br/>
