## Assignment - Build Cards from Codepen

- Build 4 cards <br/>
    âœ“ You have to create a big webpage, that webpage background could be an image or could be gradient or a solid black/green color. <br/>
    âœ“ At the very center of this page, we need to have one card just like previous login card. <br/>
    âœ“ Card has few elements an image centered or square image at top. <br/>
    âœ“ a title a subtitle. <br/>
    âœ“ two buttons : Buy now add to wishlist/cart instead of text you can use icons. <br/>
    âœ“ For this take inspiration from How things can be done. Don't just exactly copy paste it. Add your own flovour to it. <br/>
    âœ“ Search on google icon for web, one of them is [font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/start). <br/>
    âœ“ To get the inspiration How the card should look like, first of all work on the positioning of the card. If you want to display all the 4 cards at once, that's a;so fine
    if you want to have 4 different pages that's also fine. Feel free to use flexbox or grid use wahtever make sense. <br/>
    âœ“ Look for a website know as card HTML CSS codepen [Codepen](https://codepen.io/tag/card). <br/>
    âœ“ Codepen actually is an environment which gives you HTMl CSS and they tags each project which're freely avaialble for you to work or take inspiration or even you code.
