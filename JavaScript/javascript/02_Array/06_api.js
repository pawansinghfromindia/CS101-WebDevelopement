*/

//JSON
// {
// "name": "Chhotu",
// "coursename": "Mathematics",
// "price": 999
// }

// Like this you get the API call, Now you have JSON
//Now you have to learn How to used fetch() etc in JavaScript
// through fetch() method you will call url and in response you will get the data
// This is how you get values in API
// Now you know Object, you can convert this in object and get the values

/*
It is not necessary that you always get API in Objects only. Sometime you will get API in Arrays format in that case so in that array there are many objects 
then in that case we have to extract the data from Array inside Object by looping on array then get values from each object

One API is very famous Randomuserme api google it 

The JSON file you will see in not easy to understand you have to read it very carefully.

There are online tools available, you can make your own as well
Now paste your result and study the code easily as it is formated
