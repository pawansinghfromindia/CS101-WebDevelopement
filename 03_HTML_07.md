# 🚀 Multimedia and ARIA in HTML

Some of the powers of HTML do have is, especially **Semantics**, adding some of the **Media content** and some of the **ARIA labels**. <br/>

Here, we will see doc, websites from where we can learn. <br/>

## 📂 Multimedia

Media like images, videos to add in our web page we can have different different ways and there are different different attributes are there. <br/>

### 📷 **Images in HTML** :

There're two ways of handling the images <br/> 
**1. image tag** ```<img src="" alt=""/>```, and <br/>
**2. figure tag** ```<figure> </figure>```, ```<figcaption></figcaption>``` <br/>

```html
<img src="./images/programming.png"
     title="programming"
     width="200"
     alt="profile photo"/>
```

```html
<figure>
      <img
        src="images/programming.png"
        width="200px"
        alt="Elephant at sunset"
      />
      <figcaption>An elephant at sunset</figcaption>
</figure>
```

### 📽️ **Videos in HTML** :

To include video in our HTML webpage, we use ```<video> </video>``` tag. <br/>
```html 
    <video src="" width="400px"></video>
```

```html
<video
      src="./images/demo.mkv"
      width="400px"
      controls
      controlslist="nofullscreen nodownload noremoteplayback noplaybackrate foobar"
    ></video>

```
  
[Control of Video](https://wicg.github.io/controls-list/explainer.html) <br/>

Some of these controls actually can be injected only with the JavaScript. <br/>
Some of them work, some of them not, So we can actually control a lot of things with programming. <br/>

### 📽️ **Audio in HTML** : 

To include Audio in our HTML webpage, we use ```<audio> </audio>``` tag. <br/>
```html
    <audio src=""></audio>
```

```html
<figure>
  <figcaption>Listen to the T-Rex:</figcaption>
  <audio controls src="/shared-assets/audio/t-rex-roar.mp3"></audio>
  <a href="/shared-assets/audio/t-rex-roar.mp3"> Download audio </a>
</figure>
```

## 🎟️ ARIA Tags, Accessible Rich Internet Application

[**ARIA**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) = **Accessible Rich Internet Application** <br/>

ARIA tags are totally associated with the accessibility. <br/>

So, If you make any web application very rich so that any device can actually operate and served that application. <br/>
ARIA is a research field in their own, there are engineers who are dedicated just for ARIA so that application is accessible on all platforms. <br/>
It's a separate job in itself, we can't do all of this but we will try to see little bit of it. <br/>

-  🎫 **ARIA labels**
  
- 🎫 **ARIA attributes**

It is expected that every element that you're putting up here needs to have some kind of role, some kind of ARIA label so that all the readers can actually read. <br/>

Whenever you're making any application which is centric towards banking application or government websites, this is part where we come and study about it. <br/>

⌨️ **Can somebody access the entire website just with a keyboard?** <br/>

🗣️ **can somebody access it through the speech recognition softwares?** <br/>

and much more things 

[Accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Guides)

> ✨ **You don't need to go much about it, There is so much about more to learn about ARIA** Still in HTML workshops people study. As of now no need to go in such depth.
