# ðŸš€ Box Model

CSS box model, which describes the structure of every HTML element rendered by the browser. 

The box model consists of four nested rectangles: content, padding, border, and margin. 

Each layer can be controlled using CSS properties. 

The content is the innermost part, followed by padding (transparent space around the content), 
the border (visible outline), and the margin (transparent space outside the border).

How to apply styles to each layer and understand the importance of using relative units for responsive design.

The box-sizing property, which helps manage the total size of elements by including padding and border in the specified width and height.
