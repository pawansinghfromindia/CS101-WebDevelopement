## üè¶ Building a web project - Login Page

One way to learn CSS is : walk through all the ** CSS Selectors** , walk through all the **CSS Properties** <br/>
Like How can we change the border radius, add padding, add margin, change text color, change background color etc <br/>
Yes, we can learn in this way. <br/>

The faster way to learn CSS is through **to build projects**

> **Projects are the only way to learn CSS** - Flexbox

Flexbox is one such thing which allows you to position certain element at a certain position on the webpage. 
It's relatively easy. 
We will see flexbox in details later on. <br/>
Here we will see How we can centalize any element horizontally and vertically in webpage using flexbox.

#  üöÄ Box Model, Inline and Block elements

## üìô **Box Model**

This is one of the most foundational concept in the CSS and in general of the web elements. <br/>

How much space an element is going to consume on your website or on your webpage. 
It is governed by what kind of model or what ind of Box model it is following. <br/>

There are actually two box model which are generally there, Now browser should actually change the default behavior of everything to the box model 
because that's what everybody is using whether you use Bootstrap, Tailwind or any other framework of the future, Box model is the way to go. <br/>

It is safe to assume that whenever you're flushing out everything from browser, just change the model behavior to the box model. <br/>

This is so common that people are even arguing and commenting to the Web3 authorities, Hey now just allow every browser to set a default browser into the box model.

> Sometimes It is much more important to understand the code than rather writing the code. <br/> See what's happening, analyze it and then understand it!

## üìó There are 2 browser content box models that means how much space the element is going to take on your web browser. 

- ‚ú® The default behavior of browser is **Content Box**, this is going to change. <br/>
    
- ‚ú® Another is **Border Box** Every single frameworks library, they actually reset to Border Box from the default bahaviour of the browser. <br/>

The **Content box** portrait 300px but the element doesn't consume 300px It consumes more than that it adds padding, it adds border of it.<br>
while on the **Border box** the whole element whenever you say it's 300 pixel. It's a guranteed 300 pixels and that's why everybody loves it.

## üìó **Inline Elements**
Inline elements takes as much space as it is required by the content in the element, and just work with that. <br/>
It is inline, It doesn't breaks out of the line.

## üìï **Block Elements**
On the other hand Block element which consumes the entire space on left to right. <br/>
You can restrict it to be little bit shorter or bigger but nobody can takes other space. It's whole consume by it.
