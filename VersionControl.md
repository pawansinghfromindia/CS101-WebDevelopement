## üìç Introduction to GitHub Pages

How to host your websites using GitHub Pages, a free service integrated with GitHub.

Hosting makes your HTML files publicly accessible on the internet.

GitHub Pages allows you to publish your repositories online by pushing your local changes to GitHub. 

The process involves verifying your email with GitHub, ensuring you have an index.html file in the root directory of your repository, pushing your work to GitHub, 
and enabling GitHub Pages in the repository settings. 

Once enabled, your site will be live at a URL following the pattern username.github.io/reponame. 

If your GitHub page is not loading? - wait for some time & Hard refresh <br>

How to manage caching issues with a hard refresh and how to enable or disable GitHub Pages from the repository settings.

### KEY CONCEPTS AND COMMANDS

- **Hosting with GitHub Pages** <br/>
Requirements: <br/>
1. Verify your email with GitHub.
2. Ensure an index.html file is in the root directory of the repository.
3. Push your work to the GitHub repository.
4. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings.
5. View your live site.

- **GitHub Pages URL Structure** <br/>
The URL follows the pattern: username.github.io/reponame.

- **Enabling GitHub Pages** <br/>
Go to the repository settings. Scroll to the GitHub Pages section. <br/>
Select the branch to publish from (usually master). Click Save.

- **Managing Caching Issues** <br/>
Perform a hard refresh to ensure the browser loads the latest version of your site. Hard refresh instructions can be found in the notes below.

- **Using Git for Version Control** <br/>
Track changes and commit updates using Git commands: <br/>
```git add .``` (add all changes) <br/>
```git commit -m "descriptive commit message" ``` (commit changes with a message) <br/>

#### ü§î Do you know **Hard Refresh**?
If you aren't seeing the most recent version of your code, you may need to clear the cache. <br/> 
Each browser has a slightly different way of doing this. <br/>
In Chrome: <br/>
1. Go to the "Tools" menu in the upper right-hand corner of the page
2. Click on "History."
